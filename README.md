# TODO

- get multithreaded scanning to work properly again
- gitignore not working

- try using a crossbeam::sync::MsQueue instead of channels to send data when new item found in directory
- try again to get the curses stuff into a thread??
- can the continuous filter return a reference to the FilteredDirectory??
- send filter matches as events and sort/aggregate them outside of the filter
