# TODO

- try again to get the curses stuff into a thread??

- can the continuous filter return a reference to the FilteredDirectory??
- send filter matches as events and sort/aggregate them outside of the filter
- don't re-render results after backspace and filter string is ''
- store filtered results as dir tree to help speed up further filtering
- display a loading/processing spinner
